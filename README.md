# Discovery-Land

This is a HTML/CSS Project Repository.

This Repository contains all the files related to HTML/CSS trainning in BridgeLabz.

The Discovery Land page is a replica of the https://discoverylandco.com/ website.

In this project I'm creating Frontend part of the website for displaying and show multiple images and videos in the website using HTML, CSS, display Flex property and Grid property.

Softwares and tools used are VS Code, HTML and CSS.
